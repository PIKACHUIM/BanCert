MoleBox/MoleBox Pro readme

MoleBox Pro allows you to link all the files your application requires
into a single exe file. When packed with Molebox Pro, your app's media
and data files are protected from prying eyes, and your DLLs cannot be
used  by third party programs.  Moleboxed program  works just like the
original one, without any additional coding. 

Molebox Pro will help you to:
- Create one or multiple packages for an application.
- Protect  your media files,  data files  and DLLs  from  unauthorized
access.
- Manage level packs, add-ons, updates, patches  minimizing their file
size (Pro version only).
- Compress and encrypt your application and all the files it requires.

- Secure application integrity and avoid DLL conflict.
- Make program cracking extremely difficult.
